Two-factor authentication for your blog.  Stop hackers before they get into your administration section!

== Description ==

This plugin will automatically send you a text message whenever anyone attempts to access your administration section, allowing you to approve or reject them before they ever see your dashboard.  And if you ever worry that your blog has been or is being hacked, you can simply text "panic" to a special phone number and your whole blog administration section shuts down, leaving your actual blog untouched!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this protect my blog? =

If someone has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack">brute-forced your password</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking">hijacked your session</a>, or stolen your username or password from somewhere else, they can easily access your administration section and deface or delete posts or your entire site! 

But with PanicPress installed, they also must be manually approved by you via text message.

PanicPress can be the difference between your site being hacked and its continued security.

= Does my whole blog shut down? =

No! Only the administration backend is disabled - the rest of your blog will work just fine!

Nobody will be able to make or edit posts, change or edit themes, moderate or remove comments, or perform any other administrative functions until you decide.

= I don't live in the United States. Can I still sign up? =

Unfortunately, we don't support phone numbers outside of the United States at this time.

= Do I have to sign a contract? =

There are no contracts to sign - you pay monthly in advance, and may cancel at any time.

= What number will I be getting SMS messages from? =

Add "646-480-6113" to your phone as "PanicPress".  That way you'll always know when you've received an alert, even on the home screen.
